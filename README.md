# To-Do List Application

This is a basic command-line to-do list application written in Python. The app allows users to:
- Add new to-do items.
- View all to-do items.
- Delete a to-do item by its index.
- Exit the application.

# HOW to use this application:

- First the user can enter the number of task they want to include in the beginning with the estimated time as well
- Then the program gives user the option to choose between adding, deleting,viewing and exiting
- After choosing one of the options the program works accordingly
- The program keeps on running until the user decides to exit the program

# The process of the application making:
- First revision of the basic python functions was done
- Then a structure for the application was created in rough
- Writing process of the program was started
- A lot of errors and trials
- Testing of various processes
- Rechecking by running the program
- Error fixing
#note: There are many errors which i could not recognise on my own.Hoping for a feedback on that

#The application is designed using a modular structure with separate files for managing tasks, utilities, and user interactions
